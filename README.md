👋 Hi, I'm Robin Myburg
Aspiring Business Analyst | Data Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner

I’m a former training assistant manager currently transitioning into data analysis and business analytics. With hands-on experience in Google Sheets and Excel, I’m developing a solid portfolio while completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate.

My passion lies in asking the right questions, discovering trends, and presenting insights that drive smart decisions. I actively embrace feedback and apply it to grow, project by project.
